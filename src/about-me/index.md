I’m a software engineer passionate about building high-quality tools and systems. I don’t like taking shortcuts and feel strongly about writing testable and maintainable code.  

I have a knack for interdisciplinary work, and thrive in environments where I can collaborate with engineers, creatives, designers, scientists, and artists to make a common vision come to life.  

I’m still exploring my niche and learning about where my technical knowledge can be most impactful. My work and internship experience doesn’t describe a well-defined path, but has allowed me to dip my toes into working in DevOps, biotech, IoT, manufacturing, and Android Development. Guess you could say I’m more of a BFS than a DFS gal!

Although my last two years have been in DevOps, I’m looking to get back into writing lots of code by transitioning into a Full Stack or Backend role.

What I bring to the table: 
Strong technical background
Excellent communication skills - My DevOps role was fully remote with a team spread from Maui to Glasgow! Mastering async/sync communication was a must
Growth mindset - I’m always up for a challenge and learning something new
I am super funny and cool (according to my mom) (i will be sending memes in slack)

In my free time you can catch me playing volleyball, making art, foraging, or volunteering in my community.
