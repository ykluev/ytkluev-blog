        <p>
          <strong>Hello and welcome to my corner of the internet. I'm so glad to have you here!</strong>
          <br></br><br></br>

          My name is Yulia and I’m a software engineer passionate about building high-quality tools and systems. I don’t like taking shortcuts and feel strongly about writing testable and maintainable code.  

          I have a knack for interdisciplinary work, and thrive in environments where I can collaborate with engineers, creatives, designers, scientists, and artists to make a common vision come to life.  

          <br></br><br></br>
          I’m still exploring my niche and learning about where my technical knowledge can be most impactful. My work and internship experience doesn’t follow a well-defined path, 
          but has allowed me to dip my toes into working in DevOps, biotech, IoT, manufacturing, and Android Development. 
          I guess a CS nerd would say I’m more of a BFS than a DFS gal :D
    

          <br></br><br></br>
          Although my last two years have been in DevOps, I’m looking to get back into writing lots of code by transitioning into a Full Stack or Backend role.

          <br></br><br></br>
          In my free time you can catch me playing volleyball, making art, foraging, or volunteering in my community.
